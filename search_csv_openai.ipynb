consume within 120 days of opening.. general questions about vitamin c. what is vitamin c?. vitamin c is a water-soluble micronutrient that is essential for many vital functions in the human body. while plants and most animals have the ability to synthesize their own vitamin c, humans do not have this ability and must consume vitamin c each day either in the diet or through supplementation.. as an antioxidant, vitamin c supports immune health and protects cells from free radicals.. vitamin c also has the ability to extend the life of other key antioxidants, like vitamin e, by recycling or regenerating them.. the production of collagen in the body depends upon vitamin c. given this, the health of connective tissue (skin, tendons, ligaments) requires vitamin c for normal functioning and structure.. vitamin c also supports liver, heart, eye, and prenatal health.. what are some risk factors for a vitamin c deficiency?. consuming a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables each day may provide adequate amounts of vitamin c for some individuals. however, today’s over-reliance on refined and processed foods can provide a challenge to optimal vitamin c for others. it is important to note that vitamin c is not stored in the human body and must be consumed each day, either from the diet or through supplementation. vitamin c requirements are sometimes increased during periods of psychological (e.g. anxiety) and physiological stress (e.g. infection, alcohol and drug use, injury, surgery, burns or fatigue). other individuals that are at risk for a vitamin c deficiency include smokers and those with gastrointestinal disorders such as malabsorption syndromes, crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.. are there any food sources of vitamin c?. vitamin c can be found in a wide variety of plant-based foods. consuming at least five servings a day of fresh fruits and vegetables is the best way to ensure an adequate intake of vitamin c. fruits that contain substantial amounts of vitamin c include strawberries, kiwifruit, bell peppers, papaya, pineapple, lemons/limes, watermelon, and grapefruit. the richest vegetable sources of vitamin c are broccoli, brussel sprouts, cauliflower, kale, cabbage, bok choy, collard greens, swiss chard, asparagus, sweet potatoes, and winter/summer squash.. what is the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin c?. the 100% daily value (%dv) for vitamin c for individuals 18 years of age and older is 90 mg. this goes up to 120 mg per day during pregnancy/breastfeeding. as with any supplement, please talk to your healthcare provider prior to supplementation to ensure you are following the dosing schedule that is right for your particular health needs.. is there an established upper toxicity limit for vitamin c?. the upper tolerable limit (ul), established by the food and nutrition bard (fnb) of the institute of medicine, is considered to be the highest amount you can take of a nutrient without theoretical risk. the ul for vitamin c in adults is set at 2,000 milligrams per day. this ul has been established primarily in an effort to prevent gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps) which can occur from a high intake of vitamin c. in addition, excess vitamin c (~ 2000 mg a day) may increase urine oxalate, a component of a common variety of kidney stone.. can vitamin c supplements be taken with otc or prescription medications?. taking vitamin c supplements at the same time as some medications may result in decreased absorption and efficacy of the medication and/or the vitamin c supplement. if you are taking or planning to take an otc or prescription medication, please consult a licensed pharmacist or your healthcare provider before beginning supplementation to minimize risk of side effects associated with potential supplement-drug interactions.. still have questions?. for general information about vitamin c, check out the resources below—. vitamin c fact sheet for consumers — office of dietary supplements. vitamin c — linus pauling institute. vitamin c — harvard school of public health. vitamin c in disease prevention and cure: an overview. for specific guidance on the suitability of vitamin c to support your particular health goals, please talk to your healthcare provider.. questions about vitamin c gold. what is the source of vitamin c in vitamin c gold?. vitamin c gold provides a gentle and nourishing form of. vitamin c from amla and other ingredients in the organic food blend. the full list of organic foods can be found under the ‘organic food blend’ in the supplement facts panel (on the label) and on the product page on our website. vitamin c gold is. synthetic vitamin c fermented, grown or cultured in yeast or a blend of organic foods fortified with synthetic vitamin c and marketed as “whole-food” or “food-based” vitamin c.. how does vitamin c gold compare to other commercially-available vitamin c supplements?. most vitamin c products on the market provide ascorbic acid, a lab-made compound that does not occur in its isolated form in nature and is distinct from the vitamin c that is naturally present in food. ascorbic acid is frequently used to describe vitamin c, but ascorbic acid is merely the shell of vitamin c. in nature, vitamin c actually contains numerous other biologically active compounds (e.g. bioflavonoids) and enzymes, in addition to ascorbic acid, that work synergistically to deliver health benefits.. vitamin c gold provides plant-based vitamin c from organic amla and other fruits and berries in the organic food blend. the full list of organic foods can be found under the ‘organic food blend’ in the supplement facts panel (on the label) and on the product page on our website. vitamin c gold is. synthetic vitamin c fermented, grown or cultured in yeast, or a blend of organic foods fortified with synthetic vitamin c and marketed as “whole-food” or “food-based” vitamin c.. due to its acidic nature, some people experience gastrointestinal problems when supplementing with ascorbic acid. in an effort to make it less irritating to the digestive system, some brands offer buffered forms of ascorbic acid which is made by binding it to an alkaline mineral, such as calcium. synthetic vitamin c, regardless of the delivery form, is not the same as vitamin c from living foods like amla, strawberries, kiwi, and papaya, among others. generally speaking, plant-based forms of vitamin c do not cause digestive upset and therefore do not require any extra buffering agent.. i was told that it is okay to take vitamin c in high dosages. can i take more than what is suggested on the label?. because we are not a licensed healthcare provider, we regret we cannot make any recommendations with regard to taking a dosage higher than what is suggested on the product label. however, we can provide context for why we offer a 240 mg vitamin c supplement (instead of a higher dose vitamin c product) so you can make the purchasing decision that is right for you.. there is very little consensus on what the optimal daily amount of vitamin c is and the actual amount varies from about 250 mg to as much as 10 grams per day. some of this variation may be explained by the reasons for supplementing with vitamin c. vitamin c requirement is increased during periods of psychological (e.g. anxiety) and physiological stress (e.g. infection, alcohol and drug use, injury, surgery, burns or fatigue), so depending on the reasons for supplementation, recommended dosages can vary based on diet, lifestyle factors, and individual health goals.. the recommended daily allowance (rda) of vitamin c for an adult ranges from 75 mg to 120 mg per day and this dosage is considered adequate for the prevention of vitamin c deficiency. however, if a higher dosage is warranted, there are a number of reasons why smaller doses of vitamin c taken throughout the day may be more effective than taking a single high dose of vitamin c —. blood levels of vitamin c take about 2 to 3 hours to reach their peak, after which point levels start to decrease as unabsorbed vitamin c is eliminated in the urine and through perspiration;. higher doses of vitamin c don't necessarily provide additional benefits beyond what are achieved at smaller doses (~ 250 mg);. taken orally, the larger the dose, the less is absorbed. for example, 80% of a 250 mg vitamin c supplement will be absorbed, whereas only 50% of a 2000 mg supplement will be absorbed (the rest is excreted through urination or perspiration). excess vitamin c (~ 2000 mg a day) increases urine oxalate, a component of a common variety of kidney stone, by 22%, and men who take 1000 mg or more of vitamin c have up to a 40% higher risk of stone formation.. given this, we believe the optimal dosing for vitamin c may be to take a small daily dose (~250 mg) to minimize deficiency risk and increase the frequency of dosing (~ 250 mg every 3 to 4 hours up to 4 times a day) during times of psychological and/or physiological stress to support the body’s increased need for vitamin c. as a matter of principle and in the interest of your health and safety, we encourage you to consult your healthcare provider prior to supplementation to determine what use, if any, is best to support your particular health goals.. how does nutrigold ensure the purity of the ingredients used in its vitamin c gold products?. what assurance can you provide that the amount of vitamin c listed on the label is actually in the product?. what is the best time of day to take vitamin c gold? should it be taken with food?. vitamin c is a water-soluble vitamin that can generally be taken anytime, even on an empty stomach. however, as a matter of principle and in the interest of your health and safety, we encourage you to consult your healthcare provider prior to supplementation to determine what use, if any, is best for your individual needs.. is vitamin c gold suitable for children (under 18 years of age)?. vitamin c gold is formulated for individuals over 18 years. because children are considered a vulnerable population, we regret we cannot make any recommendations regarding the use of our products by or for children under the age of 18. we ask that you talk to your pediatrician or family practitioner about whether or not vitamin c gold is suitable and safe for your child’s particular healthcare needs prior to supplementation.. articles featuring vitamin c gold\n",

bioavailable nutrients from natto and lichen. k2+d3 gold suggested use, supplement facts, and warnings. other ingredients: organic tapioca maltodextrin, vegan capsule (plant cellulose), dicalcium phosphate, tapioca starch.. general questions about vitamin k2 and vitamin d3. what is vitamin k2? what is vitamin d3?. vitamin d is a fat-soluble vitamin that has many documented functions in the human body including supporting calcium absorption, bone, dental, immune, breast and prostate health. vitamin d2 (ergocalciferol) is a form of vitamin d found in some plants, mushrooms, and yeast. vitamin d3 (cholecalciferol) is the form made within human skin upon exposure to uvb radiation from the sun. vitamin d3 can also be found in dietary supplements produced from lanolin or lichen. evidence suggests that vitamin d3 may be more effective than d2 in maintaining stable levels in the human body.. the name vitamin k refers to a family of fat-soluble vitamins that possess a similar chemical structure but differ by the length of their side chains. vitamin k1 (phylloquinone) is found in green leafy vegetables and is the primary source of vitamin k in the american diet. vitamin k2 (menaquinone) is of microbial origin and is mainly present in select fermented foods like natto (fermented soybeans). while there are multiple forms of vitamin k2, the most bioavailable and biologically active form is mk-7, naturally present in natto. vitamin k supports calcium absorption, and heart, bone dental, and prostate health.. what are some risk factors for a vitamin k and/or vitamin d deficiency?. individuals who have a difficult time digesting or absorbing fats are at a greater risk of deficiency since vitamin k is a fat-soluble nutrient. this includes those with gastrointestinal malabsorption disorders, impaired liver function and those with cystic fibrosis. the long-term use of some antibiotics may also negatively impact vitamin k synthesis and absorption. anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin, often function as vitamin k antagonists and may impact vitamin k levels and/or vitamin k-dependent clotting factors. if taking medication, especially anticoagulant medications, it is very important to consult with a healthcare provider before consuming vitamin k from food or supplementation.. are there any food sources of vitamin k or vitamin d?. most western diets today provide vitamin k1 (phylloquinone) but very little vitamin k2 (menaquinones). vitamin k1 can be found in leafy green vegetables and some plant oils. vitamin k2, however, is of microbial origin and is typically found only in select fermented foods such as some types of cheese (not processed), curds, and natto. the most reliable food source of vitamin k2 is natto, a type of fermented soybeans. natto provides vitamin k2 as mk-7, the most bioavailable and biologically active form of vitamin k2. given that most diets provide little to no vitamin k2, supplementation may sometimes be necessary to meet the recommended dietary allowance.. one of the main sources of vitamin d comes from sunlight as it stimulates vitamin d synthesis in the skin. there are a few reliable food sources of vitamin d as well including salmon, tuna, sardines, and eggs. some foods are fortified with vitamin d such as milk, cereal and juices. however, these fortified foods may sometimes contain the less bioavailable vitamin d2 (ergocalciferol) form.. what is the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin k and vitamin d?. the 100% daily value (%dv) for vitamin k for individuals 18 years of age and older is 120 mcg. this goes down to 90 mcg per day during pregnancy/breastfeeding. as with any supplement, please talk to your healthcare provider prior to supplementation to ensure you are following the dosing schedule that is right for your particular health needs.. the 100% daily value (%dv) for vitamin d for individuals 18 years of age and older is 20 mcg (800 iu). this goes down to 15 mcg (600 iu) per day during pregnancy/breastfeeding. as with any supplement, please talk to your healthcare provider prior to supplementation to ensure you are following the dosing schedule that is right for your particular health needs.. is there an established upper toxicity limit for vitamin k or vitamin d?. the upper tolerable limit (ul), established by the food and nutrition bard (fnb) of the institute of medicine, is considered to be the highest amount you can take of a nutrient without theoretical risk. the ul established for vitamin d in adults is 100 micrograms (4,000 iu) per day. however, it is common for a medical provider to determine that a larger amount of vitamin d is necessary in cases of severe deficiency.. the upper tolerable limit (ul), established by the food and nutrition bard (fnb) of the institute of medicine, is considered to be the highest amount you can take of a nutrient without theoretical risk. vitamin k has a very low level of toxicity in the human body since it is rapidly metabolized and is stored only in small amounts. given this, the fnb has not established an upper intake level (ul) for vitamin k. this applies to both vitamin k1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin k2 (menaquinone).. can vitamin k2 and d3 supplements be taken with otc or prescription medications?. if you are taking or planning to take an otc or prescription medication, please consult a licensed pharmacist or your healthcare provider before beginning supplementation to minimize risk of side effects associated with potential supplement-drug interactions. vitamin k may interfere with oral anticoagulants or blood thinning medications and should always be discussed with a licensed health provider before consuming.. questions about vitamin k2 + d3 gold. what are the sources of k2 and d3 in vitamin k2 + d3 gold?. the vitamin k2 in our vitamin k2 gold product is sourced from natto, a traditional japanese food made from fermented soybeans. we have chosen this natto source of vitamin k2 for two key reasons—vitamin k2 (as mk-7) is naturally present in high amounts in natto and the mk-7 form of k2 is the most bioavailable and biologically active form of vitamin k and helps ensure consistent blood levels of this vitamin.. all of our vitamin d3 gold products, including vitamin k2 + d3 gold, feature vitamin d from wild-crafted, sustainable lichen—a food source of natural vitamin d3. lichen is an organic-compliant, vegan, kosher, allergen-free non-gmo verified source of bioavailable d3.. which source of vitamin d is more bioavailable—lichen or lanolin?. there should be no difference in bioavailability between vitamin d from lichen and vitamin d from lanolin. both sources provide vitamin d as cholecalciferol, the form made in skin upon exposure to sunlight.. how does nutrigold ensure the purity of the ingredients used in its k2+d3 gold product?. what assurance can you provide that the amount of k2 and d3 listed on the label is actually in the product?. what is the best time of day to take vitamin k2 + d3 gold? should it be taken with food?. vitamin k2 and vitamin d3 are fat-soluble vitamins. most fat-soluble vitamins (e.g. a, e, k) are better absorbed when consumed with dietary fat (usually a component of most meals). however, as a matter of principle and in the interest of your health and safety, we encourage you to consult your healthcare provider prior to supplementation to determine what use, if any, is best for your individual needs.. why does k2+d3 gold contain tapioca maltodextrin?. at nutrigold, we are philosophically opposed to the use of chemical additives and synthetic preservatives in our products. for this reason we avoid magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide as well as additives commonly sourced from gm ingredients like corn starch, corn maltodextrin, and soy lecithin. although we make every effort to manufacture products without the use of any excipients, there are situations when an additive may be required to ensure production efficiency and finished product integrity. when that happens, we take care to use plant-based additives like the tapioca maltodextrin in our k2+d3 gold product.. is k2+d3 gold suitable for children (under 18 years of age)?. k2+d3 gold is formulated for individuals over 18 years. because children are considered a vulnerable population, we regret we cannot make any recommendations regarding the use of our products by or for children under the age of 18. we ask that you talk to your pediatrician or family practitioner about whether or not vitamin d3 gold is suitable and safe for your child’s particular healthcare needs prior to supplementation.. articles featuring k2 + d3 gold. no articles featuring k2 + d3 gold have been published yet.\n",

      "\tSegment: the case against synthetic vitamins - nutrigold. the case against synthetic vitamins. clean label: the case against synthetic vitamins. there is a lot of talk about the comparative advantages and disadvantages of synthetic versus whole-food vitamins, and there are passionate believers and ardent supporters on both sides within the industry. those on the side of synthetic vitamins argue that there is no evidence that natural vitamins work or that they are better than synthetic vitamins, and question whether it matters that vitamins are synthetic or whole-food as long as they work as intended to minimize deficiency risk and support good health. staunch supporters of whole-food vitamins, the kind of vitamins that are concentrated from authentic whole foods, respond that there may not be any scientific evidence that whole-food vitamins work or that they are substantially better, but there is certainly sufficient evidence synthetic vitamins don’t work and that they are not safe.. the lack of quality studies comparing synthetic and whole-food vitamins across measures of bioavailability, absorption, and overall safety makes drawing definitive conclusions about the relative superiority of one form over another extremely difficult. so, we invite you join us as we take a common sense approach to the evaluation of synthetic vitamins as a reliable source of essential nutrients capable of supporting health.. the common sense argument against synthetic vitamins. vitamins are essential nutrients that must be obtained either from the diet or through supplementation because the body cannot synthesize them in the quantities needed to maintain optimal health. each vitamin has a specific physiochemical activity in the body; therefore, one vitamin cannot be used to replace the deficiency of another. usp vitamins, without exception, are chemical isolates, which is not how vitamins occur in nature. vitamins that occur in nature are present as food-vitamin complexes, whereas synthetic vitamins that are created in a lab are isolated, fractionated, purified, and don’t look anything like natural vitamins.. some companies, and consumers, argue that taking a multivitamin, even if it is made using synthetic vitamins, is better than not taking a multivitamin at all. and this may well be true, up to a point. there is no doubt that synthetic vitamins, like any other vitamin form, can help fill nutrient gaps in the diet and minimize deficiency risk in the short term. problem is, they lack the cofactors required for their optimal activity in the body, and this means the body has to draw on its own reserves to get the most out of the vitamins. so, what happens when the body's reserves are depleted? that's where the arguments supporting long-term supplementation with synthetic vitamins becomes murky.. let’s assume that synthetic vitamins help fill nutrient gaps and minimize deficiency risk. but, what about their safety? synthetic vitamins are often made using industrial petrochemicals and solvents, which can increase the toxic load on the body. worse yet, the body may not recognize the isolated nutrient, consider it a foreign body, and target it for removal. point is, the potential for long-term risk to human health far outweighs any health benefits or cost savings associated with consuming synthetic vitamins in the short term.. putting the common sense argument to the test. consider the choices in the image above. we believe it is pretty safe to assume that most of us would choose vitamins from the food source over their synthetic counterparts. but, what if the body simply cannot tell the difference between synthetic and natural vitamins? would that be enough to make up for the fact that synthetic vitamins are made using industrial chemicals? probably not. well, how about the fact that synthetic vitamins are, on average, cheaper than vitamins from food sources? not even then? we don’t blame you.. the food and drug administration does not consider vitamins from food better than synthetic vitamins across any of the measures we have discussed so far — bioavailability, absorption, or safety. in fact, the fda actually considers the synthetic forms to be better because their identity can be validated and stringent lab controls can ensure a consistent and reliable amount of the nutrients in every dose. just like drugs. and perhaps the fda and other manufacturers of synthetic vitamins assume that consumers will simply accept the negative effects as the price for minimizing deficiency risk in the short term. point is, none of us would choose to take a synthetic vitamin if food-source alternatives were easily available and affordable.. at nutrigold, we believe that fresh, organic foods grown locally, picked at the peak of freshness, and consumed mostly raw are the purest, safest, and most bioavailable sources of essential nutrients. but, considering that's not an option for most of us, the next best thing is to get them from supplements that provide essential nutrients from organic, whole-food sources. if that too is not an option, then vitamins from conventional [non-organic] food sources may be an acceptable alternative. the ones that don't make the cut are synthetic, man-made vitamins created in a lab using chemicals and gmos and fermented vitamins created using those synthetic, chemical vitamins.. choosing the multivitamin that best meets consumers’ expectations and needs should not be rocket science. and yet, in some ways, it may well be harder than rocket science. unlike principles that guide rocket science, there is no method to the madness when it comes to how multivitamins are formulated or marketed. rather than adhering to a standard set of specifications and objectives for what should be included and using language that is clear and appropriate to describe the product’s attributes and features, manufacturers simply go with whatever is trending among consumers at the time. so, while it may appear that consumers have limitless choices when it comes to multivitamins, the reality is that most of these “choices” are merely new twists on an old tale.. stacking the clinical evidence. ten reasons we steer clear of synthetic vitamin isolates. synthetic vitamins are isolated and fractionated, which is not the form in which vitamins occur in nature.. many of the industrial chemicals and solvents used to synthesize vitamin isolates are not fit for human consumption.. synthetic vitamins do not have the necessary cofactors for their proper utilization by the body; the body has to reconstruct the vitamins using its own reserve of cofactors, and this can, over time, lead to nutrient depletion.. the rate of absorption of synthetic vitamins is lower because they have to undergo a considerable amount of transformation before the body can use them.. natural vitamins behave differently than synthetic vitamins (e.g. d-alpha tocopherol is not the same as dl-alpha tocopherol).. the body does not have any built-in mechanisms for making sense of isolated, fractionated vitamins; this reduces their overall bioavailability.. because the body does not have a mechanism for processing synthetic vitamins, they are sometimes viewed as foreign substances and targeted for removal from the body.. synthetic vitamins not used by the body must be removed by the liver, skin, and kidneys; this increases the burden on the body.. the toxic load on the body from consumption of synthetic vitamins far outweighs any benefits they may provide.. the addition of fruit and vegetable powders to a synthetic vitamin does not make the vitamin whole-food; it is still in the isolated, fractionated form.. consider, for example, the most common buzz words used to market multivitamins — natural, food-based, food-grown, food-created, food-state, raw code, code factors, and whole-food. while some of these are “made up” words with no formal definition, others like food-sourced and whole-food have been misused, overused, and abused so much that they have been rendered pretty much irrelevant to the decision-making process. the only hope for consumers is the possibility that the fda or industry trade organizations will eventually respond to consumer demand for clarity and consensus by creating guidelines that standardize the formulating and labeling of multivitamin products. in the meantime, we hope our multivitamin labeling review will help clarify the source and composition of different multivitamin formulations commercially available, as well as the labels that are used to market them.\n",

product are sensitive to degradation. once opened, please consume product within 90 days.. general questions about b vitamins. what are b vitamins?. b vitamins are a set of nutrients that function as coenzymes, which means that they assist and allow enzymes to carry out their intended functions in the body. there are eight b vitamins—thiamin (b1), riboflavin (b2), niacin (b3), pyridoxine (b6), folate (b9), b-12, biotin and pantothenic acid (b5). while each b vitamin has its own unique role in the body, many of the b vitamins work synergistically with each other to support cellular energy, cardiovascular and cognitive functions, and healthy hair, skin, and nails.. what are some risk factors for a b vitamin deficiency?. evidence from human research shows that a significant proportion of the populations of developed countries suffer from deficiencies or insufficiencies in one or more of this group of vitamins. unfortunately, today’s over-reliance on refined and processed foods can provide a challenge to optimal b vitamin intake. individuals that are at risk for b vitamin deficiency include alcoholics and those with gastrointestinal disorders such as persistent diarrhea, malabsorption syndromes, celiac disease, crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. pregnant women and senior citizens may also be at greater risk of deficiency. strict vegetarians sometimes require b12 supplementation given that b12 is mainly found in animal products.. are there any food sources of b vitamins?. the best way to obtain most essential b vitamins is to consume a plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables (leafy greens), seeds/nuts, and whole grains. active forms of vitamin b12, however, are mainly found in animal products and are generally not present in plant-based foods. many people today simply do not meet the daily requirement for b vitamins, making supplementation often necessary to support optimal health.. what is the recommended dietary allowance for b vitamins?. 100% dv of b vitamins for individuals 18 years and older. b vitamins. adult males. adult females. thiamin (b1). riboflavin (b2). niacin (b3). pyridoxine (b6). 2 mg. folate (b9). 400 mcg dfe. 600 mcg dfe. 2.4 mcg. 2.8 mcg. pantothenic acid. 5 mg. 7 mg. is there an established upper toxicity limit for b vitamins?. the upper tolerable limit (ul), established by the food and nutrition bard (fnb) of the institute of medicine, is considered to be the highest amount you can take of a nutrient without theoretical risk. currently, the only b vitamins that have an established ul are niacin (b3), pyridoxine (b6) and folic acid. the other five b vitamins do not have an established ul due to a lack of reports showing negative effects from high intake amounts.. upper tolerable limit (ul). not established. *ul —the ul is not based on mcg dfe, but on mcg of synthetic folate, such as folic acid or methylfolate. there is no ul for natural folate. consequently, if a product made with folic acid lists 1,000 mcg dfe, it only contains about 600 mcg of folic acid (which is far below the adult ul of 1,000 mcg of synthetic folate).. can a b complex supplement be taken with otc or prescription medications?. for general information about b vitamins, check out the resources below—. b vitamins — medline plus. vitamins — linus pauling institute. b vitamins — harvard school of public health. for specific guidance on the suitability of b vitamins to support your particular health goals, please talk to your healthcare provider. questions about b complex gold. what are the sources of the b vitamins in b-complex gold?. b-complex gold is a gentle and nourishing form of plant-based b vitamins that are derived entirely from natural food sources (e.g. organic lemon peel, guava fruit, etc.) —they are. synthetic b vitamins fermented, grown or cultured in yeast or a blend of organic foods fortified with synthetic b vitamins and marketed as “whole-food” or “food-based” b-complex. the only exception is vitamin b-12, which is synthetic and produced by microbial fermentation of multiple species of propionibacterium. the full list of organic foods from which our b vitamins are derived is included in the ‘organic food blend’ on the supplement facts panel and on the product page on our website.. how is b-complex gold different from other b-complex supplements?. the most important distinction between the different commercially-available b-complex supplements, including b-complex gold, is the. of the b vitamins in the product—in other words, were the b vitamins made in a lab using chemicals or derived from a living food source? the vast majority of commercially available b-complex supplements provide b vitamins that were created in a lab using chemicals. except for the b12, all the other b vitamins in b-complex gold are derived entirely from natural food sources—no synthetic b vitamins are used at any point during the production process.. regardless of what “else” may be in a b-complex product (e.g. food powders, nutritional yeast) or how the product is marketed (e.g. whole-food, food-based, real food, raw food), almost all b-complex supplements can be broadly categorized based on the. of the b vitamins in the product —. finished product composition. source of b vitamins. marketed as. synthetic b vitamins. (+ additives). lab-made, synthetic isolates. b-complex supplement. b vitamins + “base” of food powders. food-based, whole-food. b vitamins + yeast. lab-made, synthetic isolates fermented/grown/cultured in nutritional yeast. real food, whole-food,. raw food, food-based. nutrigold b-complex. living food sources. (e.g. lemon peel, guava leaf). categories 1 to 3 represent over 95% of b-complex supplements that are currently available in the industry and include nutrients that have been synthesized using industrial chemicals and solvents. for example, synthetic vitamin b3 (niacin) is typically created in a lab using coal tar derivatives, 3-cyanopyridine, and ammonia. even though the products in categories 2 and 3 may be marketed as “whole food,” “food based,” or some kind of food “derivative,” the fact remains that synthetic b vitamins are used at some point in the production process—either at the beginning as a starting material and/or to fortify the end product so it meets label claims.. at nutrigold, we understand “synthetic” vitamins to be man-made vitamins that are created in a lab using industrial chemicals and “natural” vitamins to be vitamins that are extracted, concentrated, or otherwise derived from living food sources. the primary difference between man-made vitamins and natural vitamins is that man-made vitamins are created in a lab and are not always structurally similar to vitamins that occur in nature. synthetic vitamin isolates do not always have the necessary cofactors for their proper utilization by the body; the body has to reconstruct the vitamins using its own reserve of cofactors, and this can, over time, lead to inadvertent nutrient depletion. furthermore, synthetic vitamins can sometimes result in gi disturbances, nausea or a metallic aftertaste.. b-complex gold is made from non-gmo verified, organic foods. other than b12, all of the b vitamins are derived from food and formulated as part of a food blend. the result is a form of plant-based nutrition that is gentle and easy-to-digest. when formulating our vitamin products, we mindfully choose organic foods as the starting material for our micronutrients. however, our vitamin b12 is an exception to this because there are no known biologically-active, plant sources of b12. b-complex gold provides vitamin b12 as methylcobalamin & adenosylcobalamin, both of which are synthetic and produced by microbial fermentation of multiple species of propionibacterium.. in addition, b-complex gold is certified c.l.e.a.n., which is an acronym that stands for conscious (or safe), live (minimally processed and predominantly organic), ethical (non-gmo), active (includes bioavailable enzymes as determined by cytosolve technology), and nourishing (as determined by the andi score).. what is the source of vitamin b9 in b-complex gold?. are synthetic or lab-made nutrients used at. any point. during the production of b-complex gold?. except for the b12, which is synthetic because a natural, vegan source is not commercially available, all of the other nutrients in our b complex gold product are derived from non-genetically modified, organic food sources. no other synthetic isolates are not used at any point during the production of b-complex gold.. should b-complex gold be taken with food?. the micronutrients in b-complex gold are derived from organic foods and are gentle enough to be taken anytime, even on an empty stomach. however, as a matter of principle and in the interest of your health and safety, we encourage you to consult your healthcare provider prior to supplementation to determine what use, if any, is best for your individual needs.. does the niacin in b-complex gold produce a flush?. niacin (vitamin b3) is a water-soluble vitamin that is composed of niacin (or nicotinic acid) and niacinamide. although niacin and niacinamide have similar functional benefits, their pharmacological properties differ. while niacin has vasodilating properties that can produce the characteristic \"niacin\" flush, niacinamide does not have this property and, therefore, does not produce flushing. the vitamin b3 in our b-complex product is sourced from organic foods and provides both niacin and niacinamide. although individual experiences can and do vary with any supplement, our b-complex gold is generally well-tolerated and reports of “flushing,” are less common than with synthetic niacin supplements.. why does b complex gold provide 36 mcg of vitamin b12 per serving when only 2.4 mcg is the rda for adults?. customers are often directed to look for higher amounts of vitamin b12 because only about 1% is passively absorbed in the human body. so, even though our b-complex gold product provides 36 mcg of vitamin b12 per serving, not all of it is utilized by the body. in fact, we are sometimes asked why we do not include more b12 in our multivitamin products, given that no upper intake level (ul) has been set by the food & nutrition board for vitamin b12 due to its low level of toxicity. (source -. ) we recognize that we are all unique individuals with often varied nutritional needs and we encourage all of our customers to consult with a licensed healthcare provider to determine what micronutrients they may or may not be lacking and what amounts are appropriate for their needs.. can individuals with a known or suspected mthfr gene mutation take b-complex gold to get the recommended daily value of folate?. there is some controversy with regard to the form of b9 that is best suited for individuals with a known or suspected mthfr gene variant. according to the. , some women have a defect in their mthfr gene that doesn’t allow them to properly convert synthetic folic acid into active methyl folate. as such, women taking folic acid may not be absorbing their b vitamins as expected. for this reason, it is preferable to take folate either from whole food sources (e.g. green leafy vegetables) or supplements that contain the natural form of active folate instead of synthesized folic acid whenever possible.. however, according to the. centers for disease control and prevention. , the most common variant in the mthfr gene is mthfr c677t and these are the 5 most important things to known about this variant —. people with mthfr c677t variants can process all types of folate, including folic acid.. folic acid is the only type of folate shown to help prevent neural tube defects.. mthfr gene variants are common.. all women of reproductive age who could become pregnant should consume 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid each day, including those with an mthfr c677t variant. sometimes a woman may still have a baby with a neural tube defect even though she consumed the recommended 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid; the defect may be unrelated to the mthfr gene variant or folate status.. supplements containing forms of folate other than folic acid (such as 5-mthf) should not be confused with the natural food folate found in fruits and vegetables. the effectiveness of these [5-mthf] supplements in preventing neural tube defects has not been studied. for more information on the difference between folic acid and folate, please click. the form of b9 in our product is not the methylated form. while it can help bridge nutritional gaps in the diet, support good health, and help minimize the risk of folate deficiency when taken in conjunction with a diet that includes folate-rich foods, we regret we do not have any information on and cannot make any recommendations regarding the use of our product by individuals with a known or suspected mthfr gene variant. if you have any questions or concerns regarding the folate form in our products, we ask that you discuss those concerns with your healthcare provider prior to supplementation so you can make an informed purchasing decision on the form of folate that will best support your particular health goals.. although we make every effort to manufacture products without any additives, we sometimes need to add an additive for optimal ingredient flow during manufacturing and to ensure finished product integrity. while many supplement companies prefer to use chemical additives like magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide, we prefer to use organic rice concentrate from usa-grown brown rice bran, which is naturally hypoallergenic and gluten-free. the rice concentrate is only added on an as-needed basis to ensure product integrity and is always declared in the spirit of authentic transparency on the product label.. is b-complex gold suitable for children (under 18 years of age)?. b-complex gold is formulated for individuals over 18 years. because children are considered a vulnerable population, we regret we cannot make any recommendations regarding the use of our products by or for children under the age of 18. we ask that you talk to your pediatrician or family practitioner about whether or not b-complex gold is suitable and safe for your child’s particular healthcare needs prior to supplementation.. articles featuring b-complex gold\n",

      "\tSegment: quality - nutrigold. table of contents. introduction to quality. our quality standards. whole-food nutrients. our industry partners in quality. our quality commitment: caring for your families and ours. according to the international standards organization, quality can be thought of as the sum of all the attributes of a product [or service] that allow it to meet the expectations and needs of the people who will be using it. problem is, people’s perceptions of quality are as varied as their expectations and needs, and what one individual or group considers to be of “quality” may be rejected as subpar by another. this makes identifying relevant “quality” attributes and establishing the standards against which those attributes will be measured extremely challenging.. within the nutraceutical industry, the fda is responsible for ensuring that products satisfy quality requirements before they are authorized for distribution. it fulfills this responsibility by establishing, reviewing, and revising guidelines for good manufacturing practices or gmps and holding companies accountable for product quality. although the intent and spirit of the gmp guidelines are well recognized, what most consumers don’t know is that the guidelines specify only the “bare” minimum standards that products must meet before they can be authorized for distribution. and, more often than not, these “bare” minimum standards do not satisfy consumers’ “quality” expectations.. although having inadequate standards is better than having none at all, the existence of those standards does not automatically guarantee that companies will actually adhere to the prescribed standards. the vague and highly subjective language used to describe the standards gives companies the flexibility to implement whatever methods and processes they deem appropriate to ensure compliance with the stated standards. consequently, companies not only differ in their interpretation of the guidelines, but also in terms of “how” they comply with them. the implications for consumers? unreliable and inconsistent product quality across the board.. bottom line, the current guidelines are problematic because the bar for entry into the industry is low and most companies are content to do just the “bare” minimum, and sometimes not even that, to stay under the fda’s radar. this has the potential to significantly increase risk of harm to innocent consumers who are either too trusting, too overwhelmed, or not savvy enough to ask the right questions or perform the due diligence required to make purchasing decisions that are safe for them and their loved ones.. at nutrigold, we understand and respect consumers’ right to products that are pure, safe, and authentic, which is why we developed our quality standards with consumers in mind. quality, to us, is as much as what we choose to include in our products as it is about what we mindfully keep out of them. it is about voluntarily adhering to standards that exceed current gmps and working with purpose, passion, and integrity to ensure customers’ expectations are reliably met. it is about ensuring that our products are good enough to give to our families because that’s the only way we can justify giving them to yours.. “at nutrigold, we think of sustainability as the “synergistic and interdependent relationship between people and planet.” the natural world nourishes and sustains human life and we, in turn, have an obligation to protect and preserve it for future generations.”. every choice we make at the company reflects our unwavering and uncompromising commitment to prioritizing the needs of consumers who entrust their own health or the health of a loved one when they purchase our products.. not all dietary supplements are created equal. supplements vary considerably across multiple attributes including source and composition of active ingredients, choice of excipients (or additives), potency, serving size, bottle counts, packaging, the claims used to describe/market them, and price. perhaps the greatest contributing factor to consumer confusion and frustration is the absence of consistent, clear, and reliable quality standards against which to evaluate products by different brands. the result? consumers are frequently misled into purchasing ineffective, potentially unsafe, product, which ultimately leads to an erosion of trust in the usefulness of dietary supplements to support health and wellness.. broadly speaking, the fda’s current good manufacturing practices (cgmp) specify the bare minimum standards that companies must meet to ensure that products authorized for distribution are safe for the general public. more specifically, cgmps required brands to have written specifications and processes against which products can be evaluated for identity, purity, strength, and composition.. the problem with the gmp standards as they are currently worded is the lack of clarity with regard to their definition, scope, and measurability. and this means companies have considerable flexibility in determining the extent to which they will comply with the standards, interpreting the standards at their discretion, establishing whatever specifications, processes, and methods they deem appropriate, and, in extreme cases, doing just enough to stay under under the fda’s radar.. at nutrigold, we consider ensuring that our products consistently and reliably meet consumers’ needs and expectations our fundamental professional and ethical obligation to them. we accomplish this by establishing “quality” specifications for our products based on the spirit and intent, and not just the language, of the fda’s current gmps.. we consciously choose pure, safe, and proven ingredients for use in our formulations; reject the use of synthetic additives and preservatives; and manuafcture our products to standards that exceed current good manufacturing practices. it is all part of our commitment to ensuring that our products are good enough to give to our families because that’s the only way we can justify giving them to yours.. locally produced foods are more nutritious, fresher, safer, promote biodiversity, support local economies, provide habitats for wildlife, and ensure the sustainability of our natural resources by conserving fertile soil, protecting water resources, and reducing emissions.. vitamins are organic compounds that are essential in very small amounts for supporting normal physiologic and metabolic functions. they are “essential” because the body cannot synthesize them and, therefore, must be consumed either from diet or through supplementation. although there is little clarity or consensus within the industry on what “natural” means or what its scope is within the context of dietary supplements, most consumers consider nutrients sourced from foods as “natural” and anything that is created in a lab to be “synthetic.”. from a purely chemical standpoint, natural and synthetic nutrients are basically the same: their molecules contain exactly the same numbers and kinds of atoms. however, they differ in terms of their molecular structure and configuration—elements in synthetic nutrients are arranged in a different way than they are in natural nutrients. more specifically, synthetic nutrients are mirror-image duplicates of natural nutrients.. many companies, consumers, and even the fda believe that the structural differences between synthetic and natural nutrients are non-significant and inconsequential, but there are reasons, both from clinical and common sense perspectives, to believe that the body can tell the difference. for example, natural vitamin e is not only three times more absorbable than its synthetic counterpart [prasad 1994], it may contain co-factors, enzymes and other bioactive compounds that work synergistically to provide intended benefits.. but not all “natural” vitamins from “food” are created equal. and one reason for this inequality is that \"food\" is used indiscriminately and without reasonable justification by dietary supplement companies in combination with other words (e.g. real food, raw food, food state, food grown, food based) to create the illusion that a product is completely natural. in fact, many multivitamin products that are marketed as “food-based” are actually made by adding isolated synthetic vitamins to base of “food” that may include a combination of fruit, vegetable, and/or superfood powders.. these food powders do not alter the structure of the synthetic vitamins themselves, do little, if anything, to increase their bioavailability or absorption, and do not have the power to “trick” the body into thinking that the vitamins are natural.. there are also multivitamin products marketed as raw code, food state, code factors, or whole-food, which are actually fermented vitamins manufactured by \"feeding\" synthetic vitamins and inorganic minerals to nutritional yeast. manufacturers of fermented vitamins claim that they use proprietary or “special” processes that allow the chemical vitamins to get incorporated into the yeast during the fermentation process, and this is in a “whole food” form that the body readily recognizes and assimilates efficiently, a claim that critics reject as pure marketing hype.. a key difference between fermented vitamins marketed as “whole food” and true “whole food” vitamins is that fermented vitamins involve the use of synthetic vitamin isolates at some point during the manufacturing process—either as starting materials, during the fermentation process, or to fortify the material at the end to meet label claims. true whole food vitamins, however, are concentrated from whole foods–no synthetics are added at any point during the manufacturing process.. unlike synthetic, food-based, and fermented vitamins, “true” whole food vitamins are are not made from or fortified with synthetic vitamins at any point during the manufacturing process like synthetic or fermented vitamins. the essential nutrients are concentrated from foods using processes that preserve the original structure and configuration of the nutrients as they occur in nature. they include naturally-occurring cofactors that enhance their bioavailability and bioactivity inside the body and include other nutrients that may beabsent in chemically-pure vitamins.. astareal® is the most clinically studied brand of natural astaxanthin and is backed by over fourteen international patents. astareal astaxanthin extracted from haematococcus pluvialis microalgae in extremely pristine conditions in the us. it has clinically proven broad-spectrum applications in the areas of muscle endurance, eye fatigue, and gastric health.. curcumin c3 complex® is an award-winning extract of curcuma longa root standardized to 95% total

sensitive to degradation. once opened, please consume product within 90 days.. general questions about vitamin b12. what is vitamin b12?. vitamin b12 is a water-soluble nutrient known for having one of the most complex chemical structures of all vitamins. vitamin b12 is also referred to as cobalamin because it contains a metal ion, cobalt. vitamin b12 has many important functions in the human body. vitamin b12 supports cellular energy production by helping the body convert carbohydrates into glucose. vitamin b12 is also necessary for supporting a healthy nervous system, cognitive health and overall emotional wellness. even the body’s genetic material, dna and rna, requires vitamin b12 for production.. what are some risk factors for a b12 deficiency?. individuals at risk for b12 vitamin deficiency include alcoholics and those with gastrointestinal disorders such as persistent diarrhea, malabsorption syndromes, celiac disease, crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. because adequate levels of stomach acid are required to absorb b12 from food, senior citizens and anyone with reduced levels of stomach acid may be at greater risk of deficiency as well. in addition, strict vegetarians sometimes require supplementation since b12 is mainly found in animal products, not plant-based foods.. are there any food sources of b12?. vitamin b12 is mainly found in animal products and not plant-based foods. reliable sources of vitamin b12 include seafood (sardines, salmon, tuna, cod), and beef, yogurt, cow’s milk, and eggs. some processed foods, such as cereal, are fortified with small amounts of vitamin b12. it may also be worth noting that certain vegetarian foods, like spirulina or wakame seaweed, often claim to have vitamin b12. however, these plant-based foods typically contain b12 analogues, which may not be properly utilized by the human body. what is the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin b12?. the 100% daily value (%dv) for vitamin b12 for individuals 18 years of age and older is 2.4 mcg. this goes up to 2.8 mcg per day during pregnancy/breastfeeding. as with any supplement, please talk to your healthcare provider prior to supplementation to ensure you are following the dosing schedule that is right for your particular health needs.. is there an established upper toxicity limit for b12?. the upper tolerable limit (ul), established by the food and nutrition bard (fnb) of the institute of medicine, is considered to be the highest amount you can take of a nutrient without theoretical risk. the fnb has not established an upper intake level (ul) for vitamin b12 due to its low level of toxicity.. can b12 supplements be taken with otc or prescription medications?. for general information about vitamin b-12, check out the resources below—. vitamin b12 fact sheet for consumers — office of dietary supplements. vitamin b12 — linus pauling institute. vitamin b12 — harvard school of public health. vitamin b12 in health and disease. for specific guidance on the suitability of vitamin b-12 to support your particular health goals, please talk to your healthcare provider. questions about b12 gold. what is the source of b12 in vitamin b12 gold?. when formulating our vitamin products our preference is for organic, plant-based nutrients. however, vitamin b12 is an exception to this because there are no known biologically-active plant sources of b12. our b-12 gold product provides synthetic b12 in its biologically active forms—methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. these bioactive forms of b12 are produced through microbial fermentation of multiple species of propionibacterium. the bacteria used in the process are verified non-gmo by the non-gmo project and verified vegan by vegan action.. what is the purpose of the \"organic food blend\" in vitamin b12 gold?. at nutrigold, we are mindful of the fact that every ingredient in a product, regardless of whether it is an active ingredient that provides a health benefit or an additive that ensures finished product integrity, can and will likely have some impact on consumers’ health. this is why we are philosophically opposed to the use of synthetic, semi-synthetic, or commodity additives like magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide commonly found in most commercially-available supplements. we choose instead to use organic, plant-based, pantry-friendly functional additives that not only have a history of safe use, but may help support the bioavailability and absorption of b12 in the finished product.. how does nutrigold ensure the purity of the ingredients used in its b-12 gold product?. what assurance can you provide that the amount of vitamin b12 listed on the label is actually in the product?. why does b12 gold provide such a high amount of vitamin b12? is it safe to take this much?. healthcare providers often recommend high amounts of supplemental vitamin b12 because only about 1% is passively absorbed in the human body. customers that are directed to supplement with vitamin b12 are often trying to correct a deficiency and may need more than what would be typically supplied in a daily multivitamin. to date, no upper intake level (ul) has been set by the food & nutrition board for vitamin b12 due to its low level of toxicity and, according to the. linus pauling institute. , \"no toxic or adverse effects have been associated with large intakes of vitamin b12 from food or supplements in healthy people.\" we recognize that we are all unique individuals with often varied nutritional needs and we encourage all of our customers to consult with a licensed healthcare provider to determine what micronutrients they may or may not be lacking and what amounts are appropriate for their needs.. what is the best time of day to take b12 gold? should it be taken with food?. vitamin b12 is a water-soluble vitamin that can generally be taken anytime, even on an empty stomach. however, as a matter of principle and in the interest of your health and safety, we encourage you to consult your healthcare provider prior to supplementation to determine what use, if any, is best for your individual needs.. should vitamin b12 be taken in a sublingual form for optimal absorption?. there is little evidence that sublingual forms are more bioavailable or better absorbed than the capsule form. in fact, according to the. office of dietary supplements. , \"sublingual and liquid preparations are frequently marketed as having superior bioavailability, although evidence suggests no difference in efficacy between oral and sublingual forms.\" considering there is no difference between oral (capsule) and sublingual forms, we offer b12 gold in capsule form because we are philosophically opposed to the use of any additives

      "\tSegment: neurocel – avanso. for good nerve care and mental health. neurocel is an unique product suitable for people with increased mental and psychical activity. contains active b vitamins that positively affect the function of the entire nervous system, including brain.. the nervous system is a complex network of nerves and specialized cells known as neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body. it is through the nervous system that we communicate with the outside world and, at the same time, many mechanisms inside our body are controlled.. structurally, the nervous system has two components: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. the central nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord and nerves. the peripheral nervous system consists of sensory neurons, ganglia (clusters of neurons) and nerves that connect to one another and to the central nervous system. neurocel nourishes nerves and provides complex care for nervous system and mind. the product formulated to match the latest scientific research on nervous activity and brain function.. alpha-lipoic acid. folic acid. methylcobalamin promotes mental activity and nerve function and helps to reduce fatigue and exhaustion. alpha-lipoic acid is powerful antioxidant that protects cells from harmful free radicals. thiamine and pyridoxine support the proper function of nervous system and positively affects mental function. niacin support propper nerve and mental activity and helps to reduce fatigue and exhaustion. folic acid supports propper mental activity and helps to reduce fatigue and exhaustion. alpha-lipoic acid is known for being an extremely powerful antioxidant supplement with special molecular capabilities. the structure of the alpha-lipoic acid molecule differs from all other antioxidants, allowing it to penetrate and protect tissues that otherwise cannot benefit from antioxidants, such as the brain, liver and nerves.. by assisting enzymes and b-vitamins, alpha-lipoic acid speeds the translation of the foods we eat into a usable energy source for the body.. methylcobalamin creates two major effects in the brain which are responsible for many of its neuroprotective, longevity enhancing benefits. first, the compound eliminates excessive levels of homocysteine in the brain. this substance is often cited as the leading cause of vascular degeneration in the brain.. next, methylcobalamin improves the health and function of nerves in the brain. it can rebuild damaged nerves and contributes to the maintenance of function that is normally decayed during the aging process.. this supplement, which is also known as vitamin b9, is essential for repairing damaged cells in the body. it feeds dna synthesis, and it’s needed for preventing anemia (a condition involving a lower than normal quantity of red blood cells).. a deficiency in folic acid may have an impact on developing the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. foods that contain folate, the naturally occurring form of folic acid, include orange juice, spinach, asparagus, garbanzo beans, lima beans and lentils.. low level of folic acid in the body can also cause fatigue and depression.. vitamin b6, also known as pyridoxine has a vast and varied impact on the nervous system. it is involved in the creation of amines, which are messaging molecules that transmit messages from one nerve to another, otherwise known as neurotransmitters.. it is needed for normal brain development and function, and helps the body make the hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which influence mood, and melatonin, which helps regulate the body clock.. vitamin b3, also known as niacin is one of the eight b-complex water-soluble vitamins. like other b vitamins, niacin helps the body break down carbohydrates, fats and proteins into energy. the most common and least severe side effects of niacin deficiency may include depression, apathy, anxiety, headache, fatigue, disorientation and memory loss.. niacin is important for proper functioning of all cells, including the cells of the brain and nervous system. when the nervous system is working properly, symptoms such as restlessness, anxiety, mood swings and insomnia can be prevented.. thiamine (vitamin b1) is one of the b vitamins family and it is needed to convert carbohydrates from our food. the main role of carbohydrates is to provide energy for the body, especially for the brain and nervous system.. without enough “fuel” from food going towards the function of our nervous system, we can experience nerve damage that can result in trouble moving, learning, and remembering information.. thiamine also helps with proper development of myelin sheaths, which wrap around nerves to protect them from damage and death.. more information on. heart and cholesterol, nerves and mind\n",
